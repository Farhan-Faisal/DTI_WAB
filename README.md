Hi Jed,
Hope you are well.
 
This is the link to the updated version of the DTI project code documentation.
 DTI_DOC
 
It is a flowchart document which shows the sequence in which the scripts should be run. If you click on a node, it will show the documentation of that script. The flowchart also contains link to a GitHub repo that has all the scripts.
 
The scripts can also be found locally at:
 /rri_disks/eugenia/meltzer_lab/NROD98/wab_xtract/scripts
 
The DTI, MPRAGE, and Lesion Map images can be found locally at:
 /rri_disks/artemis/meltzer_lab/tvb_stroke
 
Hope this is helpful and meets expectations.
 
Best
Farhan
